As of 11 December, 2013 this software is pre-alpha.  It is not even in a developer friendly state at the moment.  However, feel free to look around, add issues, and try it out if you are so bold.

Design

In the `hardware` folder, one should find the design files for the Hashlet.  The IC on the hashlet is the [Atmel ATSHA204](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8740-CryptoAuth-ATSHA204-Datasheet.pdf).
