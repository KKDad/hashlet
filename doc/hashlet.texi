Welcome to the Cryptotronix Hashlet Manual!  This manual is meant for
end users of the Hashlet, an authentication device designed for the
@acronym{BBB, BeagleBone Black}.  It is expected that readers of this
manual have some familiarity with the BBB and installing and running
software on GNU/Linux platforms.

@node Hardware Overview
@chapter Hardware Overview

The Hashlet device as shipped from Cryptotronix, is fully assembled and
does not require any end-user assembly.  The mini-cape (capelet) is
designed to sit on the P9 header of the BBB. @xref{fig:bbb}.  It uses
pins P9_19 and P9_20 for the I2C protocol.  I2C test points are
available on the Hashlet for convenient access and debugging.

The @acronym{IC, Integrated Circuit} on the Hashlet is the Atmel
ATSHA204@footnote{ATSHA204 Datasheet:
@url{http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8740-CryptoAuth-ATSHA204-Datasheet.pdf}}.
The key features of the ATSHA204 used by the Hashlet are:

@itemize
@item Hardware random number generator.
@item Lockable configuration, @acronym{OTP, One Time Programmable}, and
Data zones
@item Slots for 16 keys (14 of which are user keys, 2 are test keys)
@item Hardware @acronym{MAC, Message Authentication Code} using SHA256
and internal data unique to the device.
@item Hardware verification of MACs generated on the device.
@end itemize

The Hashlet, while designed for a BBB, is 5 Volt compatible and can be
used on other platforms like a Raspberry Pi or Arduino.  However, the
Hashlet software requires a GNU/Linux compatible operating system.
